# TRM Checkpoint Evaluation Results

## Summary
- **Checkpoint**: `/data/trm/pretrain/checkpoint_step_91.pt`  
- **Training step**: 91
- **Evaluated**: 100 HelmARC problems
- **Solved**: 0 (0.0%)
- **Unsolved**: 100 (100.0%)

## Key Findings

### Model Performance
TRM checkpoint at step 91 failed to solve any of the first 100 HelmARC problems, achieving 0% accuracy. This suggests:
1. The checkpoint is from very early in training (step 91)
2. The model has not yet learned meaningful ARC problem-solving patterns
3. More training or a later checkpoint may be needed

### Visualizations Generated
Successfully created visualizations for **3 unsolved problems**:

1. **unsolved_1.png** - Task: helmholtz_82819916_2096
2. **unsolved_2.png** - Task: helmholtz_253bf280_1136  
3. **unsolved_3.png** - Task: helmholtz_6aa20dc0_4320

Each visualization shows:
- Training examples (input â†’ output pairs)
- Test input
- Ground truth output
- TRM prediction (attempted answer)

### Files Created
- **Visualizations**: `/home/ubuntu/TinyRecursiveModels/trm_visualizations/`
  - `unsolved_1.png`, `unsolved_2.png`, `unsolved_3.png`
  - `summary.json`
- **Evaluation log**: `/tmp/trm_eval_full.log`
- **Evaluation script**: `/home/ubuntu/TinyRecursiveModels/eval_and_visualize_trm.py`

## Next Steps

### To Find Solved Problems
1. **Evaluate more samples**: Increase from 100 to 1000+ problems
2. **Use later checkpoint**: Look for checkpoint_step_5000.pt or later
3. **Check different datasets**: Try original ARC evaluation set

### To Improve Accuracy
1. **Continue training**: checkpoint_step_91 is very early
2. **Check data compatibility**: Verify HelmARC format matches training data
3. **Review model config**: Ensure evaluation uses same settings as training
