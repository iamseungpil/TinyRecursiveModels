# In-Context Examples for Two New Dataset Types

Generated on: 2025-10-24
Task ID: helmholtz_99b1bc43_1120 (ic_connectX transformation)

---

## TYPE 1: Correct DSL → Plan Explanation

**Purpose**: Given the correct DSL program, explain step count and natural language plan

**Input Components**:
- Training examples (input/output pairs)
- Test input
- **Correct DSL program**: `(lambda (ic_connectX $0))`

**GPT-OSS Response** (reasoning_effort=low):

> The response shows multi-step reasoning analyzing the transformation pattern. The model attempts to:
> 1. Analyze training examples to understand the pattern
> 2. Identify the number of steps required
> 3. Explain what the transformation does in natural language
>
> **Note**: The current response is quite verbose (~1000+ characters of analysis).
>
> **Observation**: While the model shows strong reasoning capabilities, the final output needs to be compressed to ~3 sentences as specified in the prompt.

## TYPE 2: Wrong DSL → Error Explanation

**Purpose**: Given an incorrect DSL applied to test input, explain why it's wrong

**Input Components**:
- Training examples showing CORRECT transformation
- Test input
- **INCORRECT output** from applying wrong DSL: `(lambda (rot270 $0))` instead of correct `(lambda (ic_connectX $0))`
- Expected correct output for comparison

**GPT-OSS Response** (reasoning_effort=low, final channel):

> **The incorrect output is a 270° rotation of the input and still contains the non-5 values (1, 4, 7). In every training example the output is a straightened, non-rotated block of 5s that is the intersection of the two 5-shapes, with all other colors erased. Thus the transformation incorrectly applies a rotation and fails to isolate and preserve only the merged 5-region, producing a shape that does not match the pattern learned from the training set.**

**Success**: ✅ This response is concise (3 sentences) and clearly explains:
1. What the incorrect transformation did (270° rotation + preserved wrong colors)
2. What the correct transformation should do (non-rotated intersection of 5-blocks)
3. Why they don't match (rotation + wrong color handling)

## Key Findings

### TYPE 1 (Correct DSL → Plan):
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Model generates extensive reasoning but doesn't produce a concise 3-sentence final response
- **Solution needed**: Modify prompt to explicitly request a `<|channel|>final` response with exactly 3 sentences
- **Potential fix**: Add in-context example showing the desired output format

### TYPE 2 (Wrong DSL → Error):
- ✅ **Success**: Model produced a perfect 3-sentence error explanation
- ✅ Correctly identified the wrong transformation (rotation)
- ✅ Clearly explained the mismatch with training examples
- **Ready for production**: This format works well as-is

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **For TYPE 1**: Revise the prompt to include an in-context example showing the desired concise format:
   ```
   Example correct response format:
   "This problem requires a single-step transformation. The transformation identifies
   two separate blocks of color 5 in the input and fills the gap between them with
   color 5, creating a connected horizontal bridge while removing all other colors."
   ```

2. **For TYPE 2**: Current prompt works well - proceed with full dataset generation

3. **Validation**: Generate 10-20 more examples of each type to verify consistency before scaling to full 8,572 samples
