    "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce explanation of transformation for test input. The transformation is lambda (ic_connectX $0) meaning \"Fills the horizontal gap between two separate blocks of the same color.\" So we need to analyze the test input grid.\n\nTest Input (10x10):\n\nRow0: 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 7 0\nRow1: all zeros\nRow2: 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: all zeros\nRow7: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow8: same\nRow9: all zeros\n\nWe need to fill horizontal gaps between two separate blocks of the same color. Which colors? Color 5 appears in two separate blocks: left block columns 0-3 rows 2-5, right block columns 7-9 rows 2-5. Gap columns 4-6 are zeros. So we fill that gap horizontally with 5's. Similarly, color 5 also appears in rows 7-8 columns 3-6, but that block is contiguous horizontally already. No other separate blocks of same color? Color 1 only one pixel. Color 4 only one. Color 7 only one. So only color 5 has horizontal gaps.\n\nAfter transformation, we should have contiguous block rows 2-5 columns 0-9 filled with 5. But careful: the block at rows 2-5 columns 0-3 and 7-9 are separate, we fill the middle columns 4-6 with 5. That yields a solid horizontal block 5 from col0 to col9 for rows 2-5. But what about rows 7-8: they already have a block of 5 from col3-6, but there is no other 5 block separated horizontally on same row? Actually the block at rows 7-8 columns 3-6 is contiguous; we don't modify it.\n\nAlso, we should consider if the transformation fills gaps across rows? The rule says fill horizontal gap between two separate blocks of the same color. Likely only within same row? But in example 1: There were two separate blocks of 5 at rows 3-5 columns? Let's examine example 1 input and output.\n\nExample 1 input: There's block of 5 at rows 2-5 columns 1-2? Wait let's list. Input rows 0-9.\n\nRow2: 0 5 5 0...\nRow3: 0 5 5 0... 0 5 5 5\nRow4: same as row3\nRow5: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nSo there are two separate blocks at rows 2-5 columns 1-2 (left block) and rows 3-5 columns 6-8? Wait columns 6-8 have 5's at rows 3-5. Then rows 5-7 columns 3-5 have 5's. In output, they merged into a block of 5 from columns 3-6 rows 3-4? Wait output shows at rows 3-4 columns 3-6 are 5. So they filled the gap between left block and right block horizontally across rows 3-4? Wait let's analyze:\n\nOutput example 1 has 5's at rows 3-4 columns 3-6. That means they took two separate vertical/horizontal blocks and filled between them to create a horizontal contiguous block of 5's. The original left block at columns 1-2 rows 2-5, right block at columns 6-8 rows 3-5. They filled columns 3-5 rows 3-4 to connect them horizontally. Notice they didn't fill entire rows 2-5 columns 3-5 because left block only existed rows 2-5, right block rows 3-5. They only fill where both blocks overlapped vertically to create a continuous horizontal line? Actually they filled a 2-row high block connecting the two clusters. They didn't extend below row 5 or above row 2. So the rule seems: For each pair of separate blocks of the same color that align vertically (i.e., share at least one row index?), fill the horizontal gap between them across the rows where both blocks exist? Let's examine example 2.\n\nExample 2 input: There are many 5's. In output, they formed vertical column of 5's at column ",

    "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a concise explanation of the transformation for the test input. The transformation program is (lambda (mirrorX $0)). That's horizontal mirroring (mirrorX). So we reflect grid horizontally, meaning left to right swapped.\n\nWe need 3-4 sentences max. Each step: Step 1: Mirror the entire grid horizontally, swapping left and right sides while preserving all cell colors. Then final summary: The output is the horizontally mirrored version of the input grid.\n\nBut we need to consider the example outputs: In Example 1, the input had 3 at (2,1) and 4 at (2,4). Output has 3 at (2,1), 4 at (2,4) and also 4 at (2,5?) Actually output: row 2: 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0 3 0. That seems to have mirrored the pattern? Let's analyze: Input grid 5x5. They output 10x10 grid. Wait. The transformation program is (lambda (mirrorX $0)). But output is 10x10. Example 1: Input 5x5. Output 10x10. So not just mirroring. They expanded grid doubling size? Wait look at Example 2: Input 3x3. Output 3x6? Actually output 3x6: row length 6. So they doubled width? Let's check: Example 2 input: 3x3: rows: [3 0 0], [0 0 0], [0 0 4]. Output: 3x6: [3 0 0 0 0 3], [0 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 4 4 0 0]. They mirrored horizontally and also added mirrored pattern of non-zero cells? Let's analyze: Input has 3 at (0,0). Output has 3 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,5). That's mirror across vertical axis? They didn't shift? They mirrored the entire grid horizontally, but also duplicate existing non-zero cells? Actually mirrorX means reflect across vertical axis: left-right swapping. But the output width doubled from 3 to 6. MirrorX would produce 3x3 output: 3 0 0 -> 0 0 3? Wait reflection of row [3 0 0] horizontally would become [0 0 3]. But output row is [3 0 0 0 0 3], which is original row then reversed? Wait [3 0 0 0 0 3] is symmetrical: original left side 3 0 0 then right side 0 0 3. That is like concatenating original and its mirror, not flipping the entire grid. So maybe mirrorX replicates the grid and then appends its mirror copy to the right. So new width = 2 * original width. Similarly in Example 1: 5x5 input, output 5x10? Actually output is 5 rows of 10 columns: yes. So they doubled width. And the pattern: original left 5 columns, right 5 columns are mirror of left? Let's check example1: Input row 2: [0 3 0 0 4] (indices 0-4). Output row 2: [0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0 3 0] (indices 0-9). That is left half: 0 3 0 0 4, right half: 4 0 0 3 0? Wait right half positions 5-9: 4 0 0 3 0. That's the mirror of left half? Let's mirror left half horizontally: left half reversed: 4 0 0 3 0. Yes matches. So output is left original + mirrored copy of left original. Good.\n\nThus transformation program (lambda (mirrorX $0)) means horizontally mirror and duplicate.\n\nNow test input: 10x10 grid. Output should be 10x20 grid (doubling width). We need to explain transformation: Step 1: Duplicate each row, appending a mirrored copy of its left half to the right. Step 2: The mirrored copy is a horizontal reflection of the original row. Step 3: All cell colors preserved. Final summary: The output grid is twice as wide, with each original row followed by its horizontal mirror.\n\nWe need 3-4 sentences. So we can do 3 steps and final summary. Must use Step 1:, Step 2:, Step 3:, then final summary sentence. Keep each step one sentence. So we have 4 sentences total. Good.\n\nLet's produce.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Step 1:** Duplicate each row of",

    "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to provide a concise explanation of the transformation for the test input, based on the program: (lambda (ic_erasecol c1 $0)). The DSL says ic_erasecol: Replaces all cells of a specific color with black (0). And the program receives c1 as argument? The transformation program: (lambda (ic_erasecol c1 $0)). That likely means apply ic_erasecol with color c1. The color c1 is the first argument? Actually the program is a lambda with arguments ic_erasecol c1 $0. So it will call ic_erasecol with color c1, on the grid. $0 refers to the input grid. So step: replace all cells of color c1 with 0. We need to specify the color c1? In the test input, the grid is:\n\n7 6 1\n6 7 6\n6 2 2\n\nWe need to determine the color c1 from the program? The program likely uses the first argument c1 that will be specified somewhere else, maybe it's a placeholder for the color to erase. But the problem statement: \"Transformation Program: (lambda (ic_erasecol c1 $0))\". Usually, this means that the transformation will erase the color c1 from the grid. But we need to know which color is c1. The test input maybe expects c1 to be a specific value, but not given. The ARC puzzle might have a specific rule: maybe erase the color that appears most frequently? But we need to infer from training examples.\n\nLet's examine training examples to see pattern of operation. Example 1 Input and Output: Let's see differences: Input grid 6x6. Output grid shows zeros replacing some cells. Which color replaced? Let's compare.\n\nExample 1 Input rows:\nRow1: 1 2 7 1 1 1\nRow2: 2 1 7 7 2 6\nRow3: 2 1 2 6 2 1\nRow4: 1 2 1 7 6 2\nRow5: 2 7 1 2 7 1\nRow6: 2 1 6 2 7 7\n\nOutput:\nRow1: 0 2 7 0 0 0\nRow2: 2 0 7 7 2 6\nRow3: 2 0 2 6 2 0\nRow4: 0 2 0 7 6 2\nRow5: 2 7 0 2 7 0\nRow6: 2 0 6 2 7 7\n\nSo which cells changed? All 1's turned to 0? Let's check: In input, cells with 1: positions: (1,1),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,2),(3,2),(3,6),(4,1),(4,3),(5,3),(5,6),(6,2). In output, those positions are 0? Let's check each: (1,1) -> 0 yes. (1,4) -> 0 yes. (1,5)->0 yes. (1,6)->0 yes. (2,2)->0 yes. (3,2)->0 yes. (3,6)->0 yes. (4,1)->0 yes. (4,3)->0 yes. (5,3)->0 yes. (5,6)->0 yes. (6,2)->0 yes. So all 1's replaced with 0. So c1=1. So the program erases color 1.\n\nExample 2 Input and Output: Input grid 7x7. Output grid: many zeros. Let's check which color turned to zero. In Input, we see many 1's? For example, row2: 6 7 1 1 7 7 1. Row3: 7 7 2 1 2 6 6. Row5: 7 2 7 1 2 7 2. Row6: 6 6 6 2 2 1 1. Row7: 6 2 6 6 6 6 6. Color 1 appears in many places. In output, those positions become 0? Let's verify: Row2: 6 7 0 0 7 7 0 (positions 3,4,7 changed to 0). Row3: 7 7 2 0 2 6 6 (pos4 changed to 0). Row5: 7 2 7 0 2 7 2 (pos4 changed to 0). Row6: 6 6 6",

    "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze what ic_fill does. From examples: The input grids have patterns of 1s on background 9s. The output grid is all 9s. So ic_fill likely fills interior of shapes? Wait: In Example 1 input, there are many 1s forming shapes, but output is all 9s. The transformation program is lambda (ic_fill $0). So ic_fill presumably fills holes inside shapes? But output is all 9s: maybe it fills 1s with 9? Actually input has 1s as shapes on background 9. The output has no 1s. So ic_fill likely \"fills empty cells within colored regions\" i.e., fill interior of each region of 1s with the region's background? But there are no holes. Wait the DSL says ic_fill: Fills empty cells within colored regions. That means if there is a region of a color, any holes inside that region are filled with that color. But here 1s form shapes maybe with holes of 9 inside? Actually shapes of 1s may have internal 9s. Example 1: look at row 3: 9 9 9 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 9 1 9 9 9. There's a cluster of 1s. Are there any 9s inside that cluster? Possibly the 1 cluster encloses a 9? Let's inspect: The cluster of 1s in the upper left might have some 9 inside? I'm not sure. But output becomes all 9s: maybe because the 1 clusters have holes of 9 that get filled with 1? But the output shows no 1s, meaning all 1s were turned into 9s. That suggests maybe ic_fill fills empty cells within colored regions with another color? Wait \"Fills empty cells within colored regions\" might refer to filling holes inside shapes with the background color? Actually \"empty cells\" could be 9s inside the region. So if you have region of 1s, any 9s surrounded by 1s become 1. That would increase 1s, not decrease. But output decreased 1s. So maybe the input has 9s as shapes on background 1? But no, background is 9.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to fill the interior of the shapes (holes) with the background color (9). That would remove 1s? Wait filling holes with background would produce more 9s but 1s remain. So output would still have 1s on top of 9 background. But output has all 9s. So maybe ic_fill fills the entire colored region with background? But that would produce all 9s. But that seems like erasing the shapes. That might be the function: Fill empty cells within colored regions: meaning fill the region's empty cells? Actually maybe the definition is wrong for this puzzle.\n\nLet's examine Example 2: Input has 1s forming shapes on 9 background. Output is all 9s. So same effect. So transformation is to remove all 1s and leave only 9 background. So ic_fill apparently does that. But maybe it's filling interior of colored regions with the background color, effectively erasing the shape because the shape had holes? But the shape might be fully filled? Wait a shape of 1s might have interior cells that are 9 (holes). If you fill those holes with 1, you'd get a solid shape. But output is all 9, not solid shape. So maybe shape had no holes and ic_fill turns shape into background.\n\nCould it be \"fills empty cells within colored regions\" meaning fill the empty cells that are in the shape but currently empty (i.e., 9) with the shape's color? That would not remove shape. So maybe the shapes are just outlines, and after filling they become solid shapes but still 1s, not removed.\n\nThus, the transformation in example is to fill all 1s with 9. So maybe ic_fill means fill shape with background color. That is, for each color region, replace all cells of that color with background color? But that would be just erasing. But why would that be called fill? Maybe because you \"fill\" the region with something else.\n\nLet's check the test input: There are 1s in various shapes. Output should be all 9s. So the transformation is simply replace all 1s with 9s. So the step is: Replace every cell of color 1 with color 9. That's the transformation.\n\nThus, explanation: Step 1: Replace all cells with value 1 with 9. Step 2: None. But we need 3-4 sentences. So we can have Step 1: Replace all 1s with 9. Step 2: (no further changes). Final summary: The grid",

    "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to explain transformation: lambda (ic_center $0) meaning \"Centers the colored pattern within the grid\". Given the test input grid, we need to center the colored pattern. The pattern of colored cells likely includes numbers 2,8,1,3 etc. We need to explain step: find bounding box of colored cells, compute offsets to center, shift pattern accordingly. So Step 1: Identify bounding box of all non-zero cells. Step 2: Compute horizontal and vertical offsets to center bounding box in grid. Step 3: Shift all colored cells by those offsets, clearing original positions. Step 4: Optionally, fill unused positions with zeros. Final summary: The pattern is relocated to the grid center without changing relative positions.\n\nWe need 3-4 sentences. Steps 1-3 maybe. Let's produce 4 sentences: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Summary. Or Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4? We can do 4 steps: Step 1: find bounding box; Step 2: compute offsets; Step 3: shift cells; Step 4: clear original cells. Then summary. That's 5 sentences though. We need max 4 sentences total. So we can combine step 3 and 4: shift and clear simultaneously. So 3 steps plus summary: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 (shift and clear), Summary. That's 4 sentences. Let's do that.\n\nMake sure each step is one sentence.
