**Correct Transformation Program:** (lambda (ic_connectX $0))

Your task is to provide a CONCISE analysis (approximately 3 sentences) that includes:
1. How many transformation steps are required for this problem
2. A natural language explanation of what the transformation does

Keep your response brief and focused. Do NOT output grids or code.

GPT-OSS RESPONSE (TYPE 1):

analysisWe need to infer transformation from training examples. Let's analyze.

Example 1 Input: There's a 10x10 grid. There are clusters of 5's forming shapes. Output shows that only a middle cluster of 5's remains (the one at positions (3-4,3-5?) Actually output shows 5's at rows 3-4 columns 3-6? Let's examine: output row 3 (index 3) has 5s at columns 3-6? Wait output row 3: "0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0". So columns 3-6 inclusive 4 cells. Row 4 same. So a 2x4 rectangle of 5's at center. Input had many 5 clusters: a 2x2 block at (2,1-2?) Let's map: Input row 2: "0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0" => 5s at (2,1) and (2,2). Row 3: same. Row 4: "0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5" => 5s at (4,1-2) and (4,7-9). Row 5 same. Rows 6-8: "0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0" => 5s at (6-8,3-5). So input has two distinct 2x2 blocks at left, a 2x3 block at right, and a 3x3 block at center? Actually center block is 3x3: rows 6-8, cols 3-5. Output keeps only the center block but changed to 2x4 rectangle? Wait center block originally 3 rows (6,7,8) and 3 columns (3,4,5). Output shows 2 rows only (rows 3-4) and columns 3-6. So transformation: maybe shift the center block up? The output block seems to be the intersection of the two left blocks? No.

Let's examine Example 2. Input: There is a 5 cluster at the right side? Input rows 2-5: "0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5" etc. So a 4x5 block of 5's at columns 2-6, rows 2-5. Also at rows 6: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5" (2x?).

Rows 7-8: "5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5" etc. So there is a large block of 5's at left (rows 7-8, cols 0-3) and at right (cols 8-9). Output: only a cluster of 5's at right side at rows 2-5? Wait output shows 5s at column 7 in rows 2-5. And at rows 7-8: columns 4-7. So output shape is basically the same shapes but moved left? Let's analyze more precisely.

Input had a 4x5 block at columns 2-6 rows 2-5. Output has a 4x1 column of 5's at column 7 rows 2-5. So the block was collapsed horizontally to a single column? The other block at rows 7-8, columns 0-3 and 8-9: two separate 2x4 blocks separated. Output shows a 2x4 block at columns 4-7 rows 7-8. So left block moved right by 4 columns; right block moved left by 4 columns? So transformation seems to merge two blocks into a single block in the middle? Actually both left and right blocks are combined into a single block centered horizontally relative to input bounding boxes.

Maybe the rule: Identify two largest horizontal rectangles of 5's that are symmetric across vertical axis? Then shift them to meet in the middle, aligning them? In Example 1, left block (2x2) and right block (2x3) maybe shift to center? But output shows only center block remains, not left or right.

Let's analyze Example 1 more: Input had left block 2x2 at (2-3,1-2). Right block 2x3 at (4-5,7-9). Center block 3x3 at (6-8,3-5). Output shows a 2x4 block at (3-4,3-6). So it's like the center block's top row was moved up and one column added to the right? Actually center
