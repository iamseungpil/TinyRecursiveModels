# Self-Correction Loop Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the self-correction loop for the hybrid ARC model as originally planned. The model now attempts to solve each problem up to 3 times, regenerating text with feedback after each failure.

## Changes Made

### 1. models/hybrid_model.py - Core Self-Correction Logic

**Modified: `forward()` method**

#### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Multi-attempt Loop (up to max_attempts=3)**
   - Iterates through attempts until max_attempts reached or all samples correct
   - Tracks per-sample attempt counts

2. **Feedback Mechanism**
   - First attempt: Uses original problem text
   - Subsequent attempts: Adds feedback message:
     ```
     [FEEDBACK] Previous attempt {N} was incorrect.
     Please reconsider the pattern and try a different approach.
     ```

3. **Per-Sample Retry Tracking**
   - Uses `samples_to_retry` boolean mask to track which samples need more attempts
   - Only regenerates text for samples that failed
   - Samples that succeed early stop retrying

4. **Early Stopping**
   - If all samples in batch become correct, loop breaks early
   - Saves computation when problems are solved before max_attempts

5. **Memory-Efficient Gradient Handling**
   - **Training mode**: Only compute gradients on FINAL attempt
     - Attempts 1-(max_attempts-1): Use `torch.no_grad()`
     - Final attempt: Gradients enabled for backprop
   - **Inference mode**: All attempts use `torch.no_grad()`
   - Prevents OOM from accumulating gradients across 3 attempts

6. **Attempt Statistics**
   - Returns `attempts: [batch]` tensor showing attempts used per sample
   - Example: [1, 2, 3] means sample 0 succeeded on attempt 1, sample 1 on attempt 2, sample 2 used all 3

#### Code Structure:

```python
def forward(self, problem_texts, problem_grids, target_grids=None):
    # Initialize tracking
    samples_to_retry = torch.ones(batch_size, dtype=torch.bool)
    attempts_used = torch.zeros(batch_size, dtype=torch.long)

    # Self-correction loop
    for attempt in range(self.max_attempts):
        # 1. Prepare prompts (add feedback if attempt > 0)
        if attempt > 0:
            current_texts = add_feedback(problem_texts, attempt)
        else:
            current_texts = problem_texts

        # 2. Generate text → extract z_init (no gradients)
        with torch.no_grad():
            z_init, _ = self.text_module(current_texts)

        # 3. Generate grid (gradients only on last attempt during training)
        if self.training and attempt < self.max_attempts - 1:
            with torch.no_grad():
                grid_logits, grid_pred = self.grid_module(z_init, problem_grids)
        else:
            grid_logits, grid_pred = self.grid_module(z_init, problem_grids)

        # 4. Update attempts counter
        attempts_used[samples_to_retry] = attempt + 1

        # 5. Check correctness and update retry mask
        if target_grids is not None:
            is_correct = (grid_pred == target_grids).all(dim=1)
            samples_to_retry = samples_to_retry & (~is_correct)

            # Early stopping if all correct
            if not samples_to_retry.any():
                break

    return {
        'grid_logits': final_grid_logits,
        'grid_pred': final_grid_pred,
        'attempts': attempts_used,  # Now tracks actual attempts per sample
        'is_correct': final_is_correct,
        'z_init': final_z_init
    }
```

### 2. training/train_phase1_mvp.py - Training Loop Updates

**Modified: `train_epoch()` function**
- Added `total_attempts` tracking
- Logs average attempts per batch: `avg_attempts = outputs['attempts'].float().mean().item()`
- Returns `'train/avg_attempts'` metric

**Modified: `evaluate()` function**
- Added `total_attempts` tracking for validation
- Returns `'val/avg_attempts'` metric

**Modified: `main()` training loop**
- Logs attempt statistics to WandB
- Prints attempt stats in console:
  ```
  Train Avg Attempts: 2.34
  Val Avg Attempts: 1.87
  ```

### 3. test_self_correction.py - Comprehensive Test Suite

Created test script that validates:
1. Single attempt (correct on first try)
2. Maximum attempts (wrong all 3 times)
3. Mixed batch (different attempts per sample)
4. Early stopping (all correct before max_attempts)
5. Gradient handling (memory efficiency)
6. Code implementation verification

**Test Results: ✅ All Passed**

## Expected Behavior

### Example Execution Flow

**Batch of 3 samples, max_attempts=3:**

```
Attempt 1:
  Sample 0: ✓ Correct → attempts=1, stop retrying
  Sample 1: ✗ Wrong → attempts=1, retry
  Sample 2: ✗ Wrong → attempts=1, retry

Attempt 2:
  Sample 0: (skipped, already correct)
  Sample 1: ✓ Correct → attempts=2, stop retrying
  Sample 2: ✗ Wrong → attempts=2, retry

Attempt 3:
  Sample 0: (skipped, already correct)
  Sample 1: (skipped, already correct)
  Sample 2: ✗ Still wrong → attempts=3, max reached

Final Results:
  attempts: [1, 2, 3]
  is_correct: [True, True, False]
```

### Training Implications

1. **Batch Size Considerations**
   - With max_attempts=3, effective forward passes = up to 3x batch size
   - Current config: batch_size=1, grad_accumulation=8
   - Worst case: 3 attempts × 8 accumulation = 24 forward passes per optimizer step

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Text generation (frozen LLaMA): ~16GB VRAM
   - Grid module gradients: Only on final attempt
   - Intermediate attempts: No gradient storage
   - Expected: Minimal memory increase vs single attempt

3. **Training Time**
   - Best case: 1.0× (all correct on first try)
   - Worst case: 3.0× (all need 3 attempts)
   - Expected: ~1.5-2.0× initial, improving as model learns

4. **Convergence Benefits**
   - Model learns from self-correction signal
   - Feedback mechanism provides explicit error signal
   - Should reduce attempts needed over training epochs

## Configuration

No config changes needed. Current settings:
```yaml
model:
  max_attempts: 3  # Already configured
```

## Verification

Run test suite:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/TinyRecursiveModels/gpt-integration
python test_self_correction.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ All tests passed! Self-correction loop implemented correctly.

Key features implemented:
  1. ✓ Loop up to max_attempts times
  2. ✓ Feedback added to failed attempts
  3. ✓ Per-sample attempts tracking
  4. ✓ Early stopping when all samples correct
  5. ✓ Gradient only on last attempt (training)
  6. ✓ Memory efficient implementation

Ready for training!
```

## Next Steps

1. **Ready for Training**: Implementation complete, no blockers
2. **Monitoring**: Track `train/avg_attempts` and `val/avg_attempts` in WandB
3. **Expected Progression**: Average attempts should decrease over epochs as model improves
4. **Optimization**: If training is slow, can reduce max_attempts to 2 or add attempt budget

## Technical Notes

### Why Gradient Only on Last Attempt?

**Problem**: Computing gradients for all 3 attempts would:
- Store 3× computation graphs in memory
- Risk OOM on GPU with large models (LLaMA-8B + Grid decoder)

**Solution**: Only backprop on final attempt
- Training signal: "Given the problem, produce the correct grid"
- Intermediate attempts guide the model but don't consume memory
- Text module is frozen anyway, so only grid module needs gradients

### Why Per-Sample Tracking?

**Problem**: Different samples have different difficulty
- Easy problems: Solved on attempt 1
- Hard problems: Need all 3 attempts
- Batch-level tracking would waste computation

**Solution**: `samples_to_retry` mask
- Only retry samples that failed
- Early stopping when batch is done
- Accurate per-sample attempt counts for analysis

### Feedback Format

Current format:
```
[FEEDBACK] Previous attempt {N} was incorrect.
Please reconsider the pattern and try a different approach.
```

**Future Improvements** (not implemented):
- Add grid diff information
- Specify which cells were wrong
- Provide hints about the correct pattern
- Use more sophisticated prompting strategies

## Performance Expectations

| Metric | Initial | After 10 Epochs | After 50 Epochs |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Val Exact Match | 0% | 5-10% | 20-40% |
| Avg Attempts (Train) | 3.0 | 2.5 | 1.8 |
| Avg Attempts (Val) | 3.0 | 2.7 | 2.2 |
| Training Time/Epoch | 20min | 15min | 12min |

*Note: Estimates based on model learning to solve easier problems quickly*
