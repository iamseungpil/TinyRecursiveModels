  "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce detailed reasoning steps for the transformation, not output grid. The transformation is leftward compression per row preserving order. We need to analyze test input: 0 2 0; 7 0 8; 0 0 0. According to hint, output should be 2 0 0; 7 8 0; 0 0 0. So reasoning steps: identify non-zero cells in each row, preserve order, move left. Provide 6-10 steps. No code, no mention of gravity_left, etc. Just explain. Let's craft final.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Step‑by‑Step Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify the rows that contain colored cells**  \n   In the test input, the first row has a single colored value (the number 2).  \n   The second row contains two colored values: 7 and 8.  \n   The third row contains no colored values.\n\n2. **Determine the left‑to‑right sequence in each row**  \n   - Row 1: the number 2 appears alone, so its sequence is simply 2.  \n   - Row 2: reading from left to right, 7 comes first, followed by 8.  \n   - Row 3: there are no numbers to sequence.\n\n3. **Preserve the original order of numbers**  \n   The rule keeps the relative order of colored cells intact.  \n   Thus, in Row 2 the number 7 must stay to the left of 8 in the final arrangement.\n\n4. **Move each colored cell as far left as possible within its own row**  \n   - For Row 1, the only number (2) moves from column 2 to column 0.  \n   - For Row 2, the first number (7) moves to column 0, and the second number (8) moves to column 1.  \n   - Row 3 has no numbers, so nothing moves.\n\n5. **Fill the remaining spaces in each row with zeros**  \n   After shifting, every unused slot in a row is replaced by a zero.  \n   - Row 1 now has zeros in columns 1 and 2.  \n   - Row 2 has a zero in column 2.  \n   - Row 3 remains all zeros.\n\n6. **Confirm that no numbers have changed relative positions**  \n   The left‑to‑right ordering is unchanged: 2 in the first row, and 7 before 8 in the second row.  \n   This matches the pattern seen in the training examples, where ordering is preserved while shifting left.\n\n7. **Check that the shape of the grid is unchanged**  \n   The grid remains a 3 × 3 array; only the placement of colored cells within each row changes.  \n   No new rows or columns are added or removed.\n\n8. **Validate against the expected output**  \n   The described arrangement—2 in the first row’s first column, 7 and 8 occupying the first two columns of the second row, and all other positions zero—exactly matches the provided expected output.  \n   Thus, the transformation rule has been correctly applied.<|return|>",
