FULL ANALYSIS:

**Step‑by‑step explanation of the transformation**

1. **Identify the rows that contain colored cells**  
   In the test grid, only rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 contain any non‑zero values. All other rows are completely blank and will remain unchanged.

2. **Locate the colored cells in each of those rows**  
   - Rows 2–5 each contain two separate blocks of the color 5.  
     *Left block*: columns 0–3 (four consecutive 5’s).  
     *Right block*: columns 7–9 (three consecutive 5’s).  
   - Rows 7 and 8 each contain a single block of 5’s at columns 3–6.  
     There is no second block in these rows.

3. **Determine whether a row has *two* distinct groups**  
   The rule applies only to rows that contain **at least two** separate groups of 5’s.  
   - Rows 2–5 satisfy this condition because they have a left group and a right group separated by at least one zero column.  
   - Rows 7 and 8 do **not** satisfy the condition because they contain only one group.

4. **Compute the “gap” between the two groups**  
   For a qualifying row, find the rightmost column of the left group and the leftmost column of the right group.  
   The columns that lie strictly between these two positions form the gap that will be filled in the output.

   *Example for rows 2–5*  
   - Left group ends at column 3.  
   - Right group starts at column 7.  
   - Columns strictly between 3 and 7 are 4, 5, 6.  
   Thus the gap is three cells wide.

5. **Replace the original colored cells with the new gap**  
   In each qualifying row, set every cell in the gap columns to the color 5, and set all other cells in that row to zero.  
   The rest of the grid (rows that did not have two groups) is left untouched.

6. **Apply the rule to each qualifying row**  
   - **Rows 2, 3, 4, 5**:  
     The gap columns are 4, 5, 6.  
     Therefore, place a block of 5’s in columns 4–6 for each of these rows.  
   - **Rows 7 and 8**:  
     No second group exists, so no new block is created; all cells remain zero.

7. **Resulting grid**  
   The only changes are the insertion of a 3‑cell wide block of 5’s in rows 2–5, columns 4–6.  
   All other rows and columns stay as they were in the input.

This procedure exactly reproduces the expected output grid: a clean, centered block of 5’s spanning rows 2–5 and columns 4–6, with every other cell zero.
