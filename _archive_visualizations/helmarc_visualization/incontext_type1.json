  "response": "analysisWe need to infer transformation from training examples. Example1 input has small clusters of 5 forming 2x2 blocks at (2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2) etc? Let's examine.\n\nInput1 (10x10). Coordinates with 5: row2 col1-2, row3 col1-2, row4 col1-2? Wait row3: \"0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" row4: same. row5: \"0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\" row6: \"0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\" etc. So there are two 2x2 blocks: left block at rows2-3 cols1-2; right block at rows4-5 cols7-9? Actually right block is 3x3? Let's map: rows4-5 have 5 at col7-9. Also rows6-8 have 5 at col7-9 forming 3x3. So right cluster is 3x3 at rows4-8? Wait rows6-8: \"0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\" So 3x3 block at rows6-8 cols3-5. So there are two clusters: one 2x2 left, one 3x3 center. Output has only the 3x3 block relocated? Output shows a 4x2? Let's examine output: rows3-4 have 5 at cols3-6? Actually output line 4: \"0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\" So a 4x2? Wait row4: columns3-6 four 5s. Row5 same. So output shows a 2x4 block? It's a 2 rows tall, 4 columns wide block of 5s at rows4-5 cols3-6. That seems to be the shape of the left 2x2 block but expanded? Let's analyze: Input left block 2x2 at (rows2-3, cols1-2). Output block 2x4 at rows4-5, cols3-6. So the left block moved right 2 columns and down 2 rows, and expanded width from 2 to 4? Maybe rule: identify the larger cluster (3x3) and replicate its shape onto the location of the smaller cluster, aligning center? But output is width 4 not 3.\n\nAlternatively maybe rule: find the two clusters of 5s, choose the one with odd size? The larger cluster is 3x3; the smaller is 2x2. Output shows the larger cluster shape (3x3) but with one extra column? Actually 3x3 would be 3 columns wide. Here it's 4 columns wide. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: find the cluster with highest row index (bottommost) and move it to the position of the other cluster? In example1, bottom cluster is right 3x3 at rows4-8. The other cluster is left 2x2 at rows2-3. Output shows block at rows4-5 (same row as bottom cluster?) Actually output rows 4-5 correspond to rows index 4 and 5 (0-based?). Input rows 4-5 have left cluster rows2-3? Wait confusion.\n\nBetter approach: consider Example2. Input has main cluster of 5s forming 4x4 block at rows2-5 cols2-6? Let's check: rows2-5 all have 5 from col2 to col6 plus 5 at col8? Actually row2: \"0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5\" So 5s at cols2-6 and 8-9. So 5 cluster shape: 4x4 rectangle at cols2-6 rows2-5, plus a 2x2 block at cols8-9 rows2-5, plus a 2x2 block at rows7-8 cols8-9. So multiple clusters.\n\nOutput: shows a vertical line of 5s at col7 rows2-5 (same as middle column of first block?) Actually output row2: col7 has 5. Row3: col7 5. Row4: col7 5. Row5: col7 5. So output has a vertical line at col7 rows2-5 (4 cells). Also a horizontal line at row7-8 col4-7 (4 cells). So output shapes are lines extracted from the larger cluster? Input had a 4x4 block at cols2-6 rows2-5. The",
