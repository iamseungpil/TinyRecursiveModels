FULL ANALYSIS:

**Step‑by‑step reasoning about the transformation**

1. **Identify the changing elements**  
   In both training examples, certain cells change from a non‑zero number to zero while all other cells stay the same. By comparing the first row of Example 1, we see that the value “1” at the first position becomes “0” in the output, whereas the values “2” and “7” remain unchanged. This pattern repeats across every row of Example 1.

2. **Confirm the pattern with additional rows**  
   Looking at the second row of Example 1, the only cell that changes is the “1” at the second position. The same holds for rows three through six: every “1” becomes “0”, and no other numbers are altered. Thus, the rule appears to target the number “1” specifically.

3. **Check the second example for consistency**  
   In Example 2, the first row contains no “1”s and remains identical in the output. In the second row, three “1”s at positions three, four, and seven are all replaced by zeros, while every other number stays the same. This confirms that the rule is not limited to a single row but applies globally across the whole grid.

4. **Determine the transformation’s scope**  
   The transformation is applied uniformly to the entire grid: every occurrence of the target value is replaced, regardless of its location. There is no conditional logic based on position, color frequency, or surrounding cells.

5. **Identify the target value**  
   Both examples consistently replace the number “1” with “0”. No other number is ever changed. Therefore, the target value for the transformation is the integer “1”.

6. **Apply the rule to the test input**  
   The test grid is a 3 × 3 matrix. Scanning each cell, we find a single “1” located in the top‑right corner (row 0, column 2). According to the rule, this cell should be replaced with “0”. All other cells (values “7”, “6”, and “2”) are untouched.

7. **Verify that no other changes are required**  
   Because the rule only affects the value “1”, there are no additional modifications needed for the remaining cells. The rest of the grid remains exactly as in the input.

8. **Confirm alignment with the expected output**  
   The expected output provided in the prompt shows exactly this change: the top‑right cell becomes “0”, and the rest of the grid is unchanged. This matches our application of the rule.

9. **Summarize the transformation**  
   The transformation is a simple color‑replacement operation: every cell that contains the number “1” is turned into “0”. All other cells retain their original values and positions.

10. **Conclude the reasoning**  
   By systematically examining the training examples, isolating the consistent change, and applying that change to the test input, we arrive at the correct transformed grid. The rule is clear, consistent, and applies uniformly across the entire grid.
