Ensure not to output grid.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Step‑by‑Step Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify the non‑zero elements in the input**  \n   In the first row of the test input we see three distinct colored numbers: a 3, a 6, and a 7. They appear in that order from left to right. All other rows contain only zeros, so they have no colored elements to consider.\n\n2. **Observe how these numbers are positioned in the example outputs**  \n   In both training examples, the colored cells in the first row were moved to the far left side of the row. The relative order of the numbers stayed exactly the same: the leftmost number in the input remained leftmost in the output, the second stayed second, and so on.\n\n3. **Note the absence of any gaps between the moved numbers**  \n   After the shift, the numbers sit in adjacent columns starting at the first column. There are no empty spaces between them. This tells us that the transformation does not just slide each number individually; it packs them together tightly.\n\n4. **Confirm that the rest of the row remains unchanged except for the zeros**  \n   After the colored numbers occupy the leftmost positions, every remaining column in that row is filled with zeros. This ensures the row’s length stays the same while the colored cells are compressed.\n\n5. **Apply the same logic to the test input’s first row**  \n   - Take the 3, the 6, and the 7 in that exact order.  \n   - Place the 3 in the first column of the row.  \n   - Place the 6 in the second column.  \n   - Place the 7 in the third column.  \n   - Fill columns four through twelve with zeros.\n\n6. **Check that no other rows change**  \n   Since rows two through six contain only zeros, moving zeros around does not alter them. They remain entirely unchanged, matching the pattern seen in the training examples.\n\n7. **Verify the final arrangement matches the expected output**  \n   The resulting first row starts with 3, 6, 7, followed by zeros. This matches the provided expected output, confirming that the transformation rule has been correctly identified and applied.\n\n8. **Understand why this rule is consistent across all examples**  \n   The rule is simple: for each row, gather all colored cells, keep their left‑to‑right order, slide them as far left as possible, and fill the remaining spaces with zeros. This uniform approach explains every change seen in the training data and the test case.\n\n9. **Reflect on the transformation’s nature**  \n   The operation is a form of “compression” or “gravity” toward the left side of the grid, but it does not involve rotating or mirroring the entire grid. It is strictly a row‑wise, left‑facing movement that preserves internal ordering.\n\n10. **Conclude with a clear statement of the rule**  \n    The ARC puzzle’s rule is: **“Move all non‑zero cells in each row to the leftmost positions, keeping their original sequence, and fill the rest of the row with zeros.”** This rule fully accounts for the differences between the input and output grids in all provided examples.<|return|>",
