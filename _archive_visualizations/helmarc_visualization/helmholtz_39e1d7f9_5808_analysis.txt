FULL ANALYSIS:

**Step‑by‑step reasoning of the transformation**

1. **Identify the overall change in shape**  
   When we look at the first example, the long horizontal line of 4’s that sits in the top row of the input ends up as a vertical line of 4’s in the rightmost column of the output. This tells us that the whole picture has been turned so that what was “up” becomes “left”. In other words, the picture has been rotated.

2. **Determine the direction of the rotation**  
   The top row becomes the rightmost column, which is what happens when you rotate the picture 90 degrees counter‑clockwise (or, equivalently, 270 degrees clockwise). The second example shows the same behaviour: a horizontal strip of 8’s in the middle of the input becomes a vertical strip in the middle of the output, again moving from top to left.

3. **Check that every element moves consistently**  
   Pick a few distinct 2’s in the test input.  
   - The 2 at position (row 0, column 1) ends up at position (row 9, column 0) in the output.  
   - The 2 at (row 3, column 5) ends up at (row 4, column 0).  
   These matches confirm that every cell is being relocated according to a fixed rule, not being replaced or duplicated.

4. **Understand the mapping rule**  
   For any cell located at row r and column c in the original 10 × 10 grid, its new coordinates after a 90‑degree counter‑clockwise rotation are (new row = 9 − c, new column = r). This keeps the shape intact while turning the whole picture.

5. **Notice the preservation of colours**  
   The colour of each cell (in this puzzle, the number 2 or 0 for empty) stays the same; only its position changes. No new colours appear, and none disappear.

6. **Observe the empty space handling**  
   The input contains many zeros. After rotation, these zeros simply move to the new positions dictated by the rule. They do not fill in any gaps or change value, so the overall density of the pattern is preserved.

7. **Confirm the output pattern matches the rule**  
   The expected output shows a vertical “wall” of 2’s along column 6, a horizontal “bar” of 2’s in the middle, and a diagonal line of 2’s descending from the top‑right to the bottom‑left. All of these features are exactly what you get when you apply the 90‑degree counter‑clockwise rotation to the input arrangement of 2’s.

8. **Explain why the shape looks the same after rotation**  
   Because the input pattern is symmetric along its main diagonal, the rotated pattern looks like a mirror image of the original when you rotate the entire board. The rotation preserves the relative positions of all 2’s, so the recognisable shape remains.

9. **Summarise the transformation**  
   The puzzle’s rule is simply: take the entire 10 × 10 grid and rotate it 90 degrees counter‑clockwise. Every cell keeps its colour; only its coordinates change according to the rotation mapping.

10. **Resulting visual effect**  
    After the rotation, the original top‑row line of 2’s becomes a rightmost column line, the leftmost column becomes the bottom row, and the overall layout is turned so that what was facing up now faces left. This matches the provided expected output exactly.
