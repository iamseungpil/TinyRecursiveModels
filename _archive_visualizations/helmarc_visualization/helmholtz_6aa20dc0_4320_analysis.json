  "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have two training examples. Need to deduce transformation. Let's analyze Example 1. Input grid 6x6. Output grid 6x6. Compare differences.\n\nInput row0: 1 2 7 1 1 1\nOutput row0: 0 2 7 0 0 0\nSo cells changed: positions 0,3,4,5 changed to 0. The original values: at pos0=1, pos3=1, pos4=1, pos5=1 turned to 0. pos1=2 remains 2. pos2=7 remains 7. So rule: replace all cells of a specific color with black? The hint says replace all cells of a specific color value with black. Which color? Let's see other rows.\n\nRow1 input: 2 1 7 7 2 6\nOutput: 2 0 7 7 2 6\nSo pos1=1 changed to 0. pos0=2 stays, pos2=7 stays, pos3=7 stays, pos4=2 stays, pos5=6 stays. So all 1's replaced by 0.\n\nRow2 input: 2 1 2 6 2 1\nOutput: 2 0 2 6 2 0\nSo pos1=1->0, pos5=1->0. Others stay.\n\nRow3 input: 1 2 1 7 6 2\nOutput: 0 2 0 7 6 2\nSo pos0=1->0, pos2=1->0.\n\nRow4 input: 2 7 1 2 7 1\nOutput: 2 7 0 2 7 0\nSo pos2=1->0, pos5=1->0.\n\nRow5 input: 2 1 6 2 7 7\nOutput: 2 0 6 2 7 7\nSo pos1=1->0.\n\nThus in Example1, all cells with value 1 are replaced with 0. So the transformation: replace all 1s with 0s.\n\nNow Example2. Input 7x7. Output: compare.\n\nRow0 input: 7 7 7 6 6 6 2\nOutput row0: 7 7 7 6 6 6 2 unchanged. So no 1s? There's no 1 in row0.\n\nRow1 input: 6 7 1 1 7 7 1\nOutput: 6 7 0 0 7 7 0\nSo all 1s replaced with 0. Row1 had three 1s at positions 2,3,6 -> all become 0.\n\nRow2 input: 7 7 2 1 2 6 6\nOutput: 7 7 2 0 2 6 6 -> 1 replaced.\n\nRow3 input: 2 2 7 7 7 2 2 unchanged.\n\nRow4 input: 7 2 7 1 2 7 2\nOutput: 7 2 7 0 2 7 2 -> 1 replaced.\n\nRow5 input: 6 6 6 2 2 1 1\nOutput: 6 6 6 2 2 0 0 -> 1s replaced.\n\nRow6 input: 6 2 6 6 6 6 6 unchanged.\n\nThus transformation: replace all cells of value 1 with 0. So consistent.\n\nTest Input: 3x3 grid: 7 6 1 / 6 7 6 / 6 2 2. According to rule, replace all 1s with 0. So only one 1 at position (0,2). Output: same grid but that cell becomes 0: 7 6 0 / 6 7 6 / 6 2 2. That matches expected output.\n\nThus the transformation is straightforward.\n\nNow we need to produce final answer: detailed reasoning steps, 6-10 steps, explaining transformation, not outputting grid.\n\nLet's craft final.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Step‑by‑step reasoning about the transformation**\n\n1. **Identify the changing elements**  \n   In both training examples, certain cells change from a non‑zero number to zero while all other cells stay the same. By comparing the first row of Example 1, we see that the value “1” at the first position becomes “0” in the output, whereas the values “2” and “7” remain unchanged. This pattern repeats across every row of Example 1.\n\n2. **Confirm the pattern with additional rows**  \n   Looking at the second row of Example 1, the only cell that changes is the “1” at the second position. The same holds for rows three through six: every “1” becomes “0”, and no other numbers are altered. Thus, the rule appears to target the number “1” specifically.\n\n3. **Check the second example for consistency**  \n   In Example 2, the first row contains no “1”s and remains identical in the output. In the second row, three “1”s at positions three, four, and seven are all replaced by zeros, while every other number stays the same. This confirms that the rule is not limited to a single row but applies globally across the whole grid.\n\n4. **Determine the transformation’s scope**  \n   The transformation is applied uniformly to the entire grid: every occurrence of the target value is replaced, regardless of its location. There is no conditional logic based on position, color frequency, or surrounding cells.\n\n5. **Identify the target value**  \n   Both examples consistently replace the number “1” with “0”. No other number is ever changed. Therefore, the target value for the transformation is the integer “1”.\n\n6. **Apply the rule to the test input**  \n   The test grid is a 3 × 3 matrix. Scanning each cell, we find a single “1” located in the top‑right corner (row 0, column 2). According to the rule, this cell should be replaced with “0”. All other cells (values “7”, “6”, and “2”) are untouched.\n\n7. **Verify that no other changes are required**  \n   Because the rule only affects the value “1”, there are no additional modifications needed for the remaining cells. The rest of the grid remains exactly as in the input.\n\n8. **Confirm alignment with the expected output**  \n   The expected output provided in the prompt shows exactly this change: the top‑right cell becomes “0”, and the rest of the grid is unchanged. This matches our application of the rule.\n\n9. **Summarize the transformation**  \n   The transformation is a simple color‑replacement operation: every cell that contains the number “1” is turned into “0”. All other cells retain their original values and positions.\n\n10. **Conclude the reasoning**  \n   By systematically examining the training examples, isolating the consistent change, and applying that change to the test input, we arrive at the correct transformed grid. The rule is clear, consistent, and applies uniformly across the entire grid.<|return|>",
