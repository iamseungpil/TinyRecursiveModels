FULL ANALYSIS:

**Step‑by‑Step Reasoning**

1. **Identify the rows that contain colored cells**  
   In the test input, the first row has a single colored value (the number 2).  
   The second row contains two colored values: 7 and 8.  
   The third row contains no colored values.

2. **Determine the left‑to‑right sequence in each row**  
   - Row 1: the number 2 appears alone, so its sequence is simply 2.  
   - Row 2: reading from left to right, 7 comes first, followed by 8.  
   - Row 3: there are no numbers to sequence.

3. **Preserve the original order of numbers**  
   The rule keeps the relative order of colored cells intact.  
   Thus, in Row 2 the number 7 must stay to the left of 8 in the final arrangement.

4. **Move each colored cell as far left as possible within its own row**  
   - For Row 1, the only number (2) moves from column 2 to column 0.  
   - For Row 2, the first number (7) moves to column 0, and the second number (8) moves to column 1.  
   - Row 3 has no numbers, so nothing moves.

5. **Fill the remaining spaces in each row with zeros**  
   After shifting, every unused slot in a row is replaced by a zero.  
   - Row 1 now has zeros in columns 1 and 2.  
   - Row 2 has a zero in column 2.  
   - Row 3 remains all zeros.

6. **Confirm that no numbers have changed relative positions**  
   The left‑to‑right ordering is unchanged: 2 in the first row, and 7 before 8 in the second row.  
   This matches the pattern seen in the training examples, where ordering is preserved while shifting left.

7. **Check that the shape of the grid is unchanged**  
   The grid remains a 3 × 3 array; only the placement of colored cells within each row changes.  
   No new rows or columns are added or removed.

8. **Validate against the expected output**  
   The described arrangement—2 in the first row’s first column, 7 and 8 occupying the first two columns of the second row, and all other positions zero—exactly matches the provided expected output.  
   Thus, the transformation rule has been correctly applied.
