  "raw_response": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have two training examples. We need to find the transformation rule.\n\nExample1: Input grid 10x10. Input has patterns of 5's in a block of rows 2-5 and columns 1-2, and a block of 5's in rows 3-5 columns 7-9, and some 5's in row 0? Actually row0 has 1 at col1, 6 at col5, 7 at col8. Output: all 5's in rows 3-4 columns 3-6. So the 5 blocks moved down? Wait, let's analyze.\n\nInput Example1:\n\nRows:\n0: 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 7 0\n1: all 0\n2: 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3: 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n4: 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n5: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n6: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n7: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n8: all 0\n9: all 0\n\nOutput Example1:\n\nRows:\n0-2: all 0\n3: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n4: same\n5-9: all 0\n\nSo the 5's moved to rows 3-4 columns 3-6. The 5's originally were in columns 1-2 and 7-9, and rows 2-5 and 3-7. In output, they are all consolidated into a 2x4 block in the center of the grid.\n\nExample2: Input 10x10. Let's see input:\n\nRow0: 3 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 9 0\nRow1: all 0\nRow2: 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\nRow7: 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5\nRow8: same\nRow9: all 0\n\nOutput Example2:\n\nRow0-1: all 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: all 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0\nRow8: same\nRow9: all 0\n\nSo the 5's moved to columns 7 (row2-5) and columns 4-7 (row7-8). The 5 blocks were originally in a big shape: a vertical strip of 5's at columns 2-6 rows 2-5, plus a 5's at columns 8-9 rows 2-5, plus a vertical strip at columns 8-9 rows 6-7, plus a block at columns 0-3 rows 7-8. In output, these 5's have been relocated to two separate columns: column 7 for the vertical strip, and columns 4-7 for the block.\n\nWait, more systematically: In input, there are many 5's. In output, the 5's form two vertical strips: one at column 7 rows 2-5 (height 4), and one at columns 4-7 rows 7-8 (height 2). The 5's originally formed a shape that looks like a big \"U\" shape? Let's think.\n\nIt might be that we are extracting the largest contiguous shape of 5's? In example1, the 5's form two separate blocks. The output shows only a single block of 5's that is the intersection of the two? Actually in example1, there were two separate blocks of 5's: left block (rows 2-5, cols 1-2) and right block (rows 3-7, cols 7-9). The output shows a single block of 5's that is the overlapping region of those two blocks? Overlap region would be rows 3-5, columns 7-9? But output shows columns 3-6. So not that.\n\nMaybe the rule is: find the largest rectangle of 5's? In example1, the largest rectangle is maybe rows 3-5, columns 7-9 (size 3x3). But output is 2x4. So no.\n\nMaybe the rule is to compress the 5's horizontally: all 5's in each row are moved to the center? In example1, row3 had 5's at cols 1-2 and 7-9. After transformation, row3 has 5's at cols 3-6. That is, the two groups of 5's were moved to center and merged. Row4 also had 5's at cols 1-2 and 7-9. After transformation, row4 also has 5's at cols 3-6. Row5 had 5's at cols 3-5 (originally). After transformation, row5 has no 5's. So the 5's in rows 5 were removed. So maybe we keep only the rows that had at least two groups of 5's? Or maybe we keep only the rows that had the 5's in both left and right sides? In example1, rows 3 and 4 had 5's on both sides (left block and right block). Row5 had 5's only on right block? Actually row5 had 5's at cols 3-5 only (center). So maybe we keep rows that had 5's on both sides and compress them to the center.\n\nIn example2, which rows have 5's on both sides? Let's check row7: has 5's at cols 0-3 and 8-9. That's left and right. Row8 same. Row2-5: has 5's at cols 2-6 and 8-9. So left and right. Row6 has 5's only at cols 8-9. Row0 has 5's none. So we keep rows 2-5 and 7-8. In output, rows 2-5 have 5's at col 7 only. Rows 7-8 have 5's at cols 4-7. So the 5's in those rows were moved to the center of the row? For rows 2-5, original 5's were in columns 2-6 and 8-9. The center of the row is maybe around column 5? But output shows col 7 only. So maybe we take the rightmost 5's? But row7 had left block at 0-3 and right block at 8-9. Output shows col 4-7. That seems to be the center of the row. But why col4-7? That's 4 cells. The left block had 4 cells (0-3) and right block had 2 cells (8-9). In output, we have 4 cells at 4-7. So maybe we keep the width of the left block and shift it to the center. For row7, left block width=4, so output has 4 cells at center: columns 4-7. For row2-5, left block width=5 (cols2-6). Right block width=2 (8-9). Output shows only 1 cell at col7. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we are taking the intersection of the left and right blocks? For row7, left block at 0-3, right block at 8-9. Intersection empty. But output has 4 cells. So not intersection.\n\nMaybe we are taking the shape of the 5's that is common across all rows? Let's overlay the 5's in all rows 2-5 and 7-8. In rows 2-5, the 5's occupy columns 2-6 and 8-9. In rows 7-8, 5's occupy 0-3 and 8-9. The common columns across all these rows? For rows 2-5, columns 2-6 and 8-9. For rows 7-8, columns 0-3 and 8-9. The intersection of all rows is columns 8-9. But output shows different columns. So not that.\n\nPerhaps the rule is: identify the largest contiguous region of 5's, then shift it to the center of the grid? In example1, largest region might be the right block? But output shows a block of size 2x4. In example2, largest region maybe the block at rows 2-5, cols 2-6, size 4x5. Output shows a vertical strip at col7 rows2-5, size 4x1. Not that.\n\nMaybe the rule is to find the bounding box of all 5's and then shift the shape to a new location such that its bounding box is centered horizontally? In example1, bounding box of all 5's: leftmost col=1, rightmost col=9, topmost row=2, bottommost row=7. Center of bounding box horizontally is (1+9)/2=5. So center col=5. The width of bounding box=9-1+1=9. So maybe we shift the shape to center at col5? But output has 5's at col3-6, width=4. So not that.\n\nMaybe we are selecting the 5's that form a pattern of two vertical strips of equal width? In example1, after transformation, we have a vertical strip of 5's width=4, height=2. In example2, we have two vertical strips: one width=1 height=4, another width=4 height=2. So maybe the rule is to separate the shape into two vertical strips: one representing the original right block, one representing the original left block, but moved to the center.\n\nLet's examine example2 more closely. The input 5's: There is a large block at rows 2-5, cols 2-6 (size 4x5). There is a vertical block at rows 2-5, cols 8-9 (size 4x2). There is a vertical block at rows 6-7, cols 8-9 (size 2x2). There is a block at rows 7-8, cols 0-3 (size 2x4). So we have four blocks. Output: we have a vertical block at rows 2-5, col7 (size 4x1). We also have a vertical block at rows 7-8, cols 4-7 (size 2x4). So output includes two of the four blocks, but different positions.\n\nPerhaps the rule is to take the 5's that are in columns that are symmetric around the center? For example, in input, columns 2-6 and 8-9. The center column of the grid is col5. The left block is left of center, the right block is right of center. The output shows the left block moved to center: columns 4-7. The right block moved to center: column 7. Wait, left block width=5, moved to center columns 4-7: width=4. That is one less. Right block width=2 moved to column7 only: width=1. So maybe we shrink each block by 1? That seems arbitrary.\n\nLet's analyze example1 similarly. Input blocks: left block width=2 (cols1-2), right block width=3 (cols7-9). Output block width=4. So width increased. So not shrinking.\n\nMaybe the rule is to take the shape of the 5's that are not at the edges of the grid, and move them to the center of the grid. In example1, the 5's that are not at edges: left block is at cols1-2, not at extreme left? It's close to left but not at col0. Right block is at cols7-9, not at extreme right? It's at col9 which is extreme right. But maybe we consider only the 5's that are in the interior (not touching the border). In input, left block touches border at row5? Actually left block touches left border at col1? It's not at col0, so interior. Right block touches right border at col9, so maybe excluded. So we keep left block? But output shows a block that includes both left and right block? So no.\n\nMaybe we are performing a kind of \"center of mass\" shift: compute the centroid of all 5's and then shift the shape so that its centroid is at the center of the grid? Let's compute centroid for example1: Sum of coordinates of all 5's. Let's count them: left block: rows2-5, cols1-2: that's 4 rows * 2 cols = 8 cells. Right block: rows3-7, cols7-9: that's 5 rows * 3 cols = 15 cells. Total 23 cells. Compute average row: sum rows: left block rows: 2+3+4+5 each repeated twice = (2+3+4+5)*2 = 14*2=28. Right block rows: 3+4+5+6+7 each repeated thrice = (3+4+5+6+7)*3 = 25*3=75. Total row sum = 28+75=103. Avg row = 103/23 ≈ 4.478. Avg col: left block cols: 1+2 each repeated 4 times = (1+2)*4=3*4=12. Right block cols: 7+8+9 each repeated 5 times = (7+8+9)*5=24*5=120. Total col sum = 12+120=132. Avg col = 132/23 ≈ 5.739. So centroid roughly at (4.48,5.74). The center of grid is at (4.5,4.5). So to shift centroid to center, we need to move shape left by about 1.24 columns. That would shift left block to cols 0-1 and right block to cols 5-7. But output shows cols 3-6. So not that.\n\nMaybe we are shifting shape to center of bounding box? The bounding box of 5's is rows2-7, cols1-9. Center of bounding box horizontally is (1+9)/2=5. So maybe we shift shape so that its leftmost col aligns with col3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to keep only the 5's that form a rectangle with equal width on both sides? In example1, left block width=2, right block width=3. The difference is 1. The output block width=4, which is sum of widths minus 1? 2+3-1=4. For example2, left block width=4, right block width=2. Sum minus 1 = 5. But output width for left block is 4, right block is 1. So not that.\n\nLet's consider the shape of 5's in each example: In example1, the 5's form a \"U\" shape: two vertical bars (left and right) and a bottom horizontal bar connecting them at row5? Actually left block vertical bar at rows2-5, right block vertical bar at rows3-7, and a horizontal bar at row5 connecting left and right? But left block at row5 only at col1-2, right block at row5 only at col7-9. So not connected. So maybe the shape is two separate vertical bars.\n\nIn example2, we have a large rectangle at rows2-5, cols2-6. And a vertical bar at rows2-5, cols8-9. And a vertical bar at rows6-7, cols8-9. And a rectangle at rows7-8, cols0-3. So shape is like a \"C\" shape? Hard.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to keep only the 5's that are part of a shape that has an even number of 5's? In example1, total 5's = 23, odd. But output has 8 cells. So no.\n\nMaybe the rule is to find the 5's that are at the intersection of two rows? Actually in example1, rows 3-4 have 5's on both left and right. In output, only those rows have 5's. In example2, rows 2-5 have 5's on both left and right (two blocks). Rows 7-8 also have 5's on both left and right. So those rows are kept. In output, rows 2-5 have 5's at col7 only. Rows 7-8 have 5's at cols4-7. So maybe we keep only the rows that have at least two separate groups of 5's. Then we transform each such row's 5's into a new shape: maybe we merge them into a single group at the center. For example1, rows 3-4 had two groups. In output, those rows have a group of 5's of width 4 at columns 3-6. For example2, rows 2-5 had two groups: group A (cols2-6) width 5, group B (cols8-9) width 2. Output shows only one group at col7 (width 1). That seems to be the intersection of the two groups? Intersection of group A and B in terms of columns: none. But maybe we take the middle column of the union of columns: union of columns 2-6 and 8-9 gives columns 2-6,8-9. The middle column of that union maybe col7? Because columns 2-6 are 5 columns, columns 8-9 are 2 columns. The middle between 6 and 8 is 7. So maybe we put a single 5 at the middle column between the two groups. For rows 7-8, left group width 4 (cols0-3), right group width 2 (cols8-9). The middle between 3 and 8 is 5.5, so maybe we put 4 5's at columns 4-7? That's 4 columns. That matches output: columns 4-7. So rule might be: For each row with two separate groups of 5's, replace the 5's with a new group that spans from the middle column between the two groups to the middle column plus the width of the left group? Actually for rows 7-8, left group width=4, right group width=2. The output group width=4, matching left group width. For rows 2-5, left group width=5, right group width=2. Output group width=1, not left group width. So inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe we keep the smaller width group? For rows 2-5, smaller width is 2, output width=1. Not matching. For rows 7-8, smaller width is 2, output width=4. Not matching.\n\nMaybe we keep the larger width group? For rows 2-5, larger width is 5, output width=1. No.\n\nMaybe we keep the group that is at the center of the row? For rows 2-5, the center of the row is column 4 (since grid width 10). The right group is at columns 8-9, left group at 2-6. The center of left group is col4. So maybe we keep the center column of left group? That is col4. But output shows col7. So no.\n\nMaybe we keep the group that is at the right side? For rows 2-5, right group at 8-9, output col7 (one left). For rows 7-8, right group at 8-9, output 4-7 (left of right group). So maybe we move the right group leftwards to the center? For rows 7-8, right group at 8-9, moving left to columns 4-5? But output is 4-7. That's 4 cells. So maybe we combine left and right group into one block of width equal to the sum of widths? For rows 7-8, sum widths=4+2=6, but output width=4. Not sum.\n\nMaybe we shift the right group leftwards until it touches the left group? For rows 7-8, left group at 0-3, right group at 8-9. If we shift right group left until it touches left group, it would be at 4-5. That would be 2 cells. But output is 4 cells. So no.\n\nMaybe we shift the right group left until the gap between left and right group is equal to the width of left group? The gap initially is 8-3-1=4. Left group width=4. So gap equals width. If we shift right group left by 0, gap remains 4. But output shows right group at 4-7, which is left group width 4 cells starting at col4. So maybe we place a block of width equal to left group width starting at the column immediately after left group. That is col4-7. That matches output for rows 7-8. For rows 2-5, left group width=5, so block would be at col7-11? But grid width 10, so col7-10? But output shows only col7. So not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we take the left group width but shift it to center of the row? For rows 7-8, left group width=4, center of row is col4.5. So block from col4 to col7? That matches output. For rows 2-5, left group width=5, center of row is col4.5. So block from col2 to col6? That would be 5 cells, but output is only col7. So no.\n\nMaybe we take the right group width but shift it to center? For rows 2-5, right group width=2, center col4.5, so block from col3 to col4? But output is col7. So no.\n\nMaybe we take the average of the two group positions and fill that with a block of width equal to the smaller group? For rows 2-5, average col between 2-6 and 8-9 is maybe 7? But width of smaller group=2. Output width=1. So no.\n\nLet's examine the output shapes relative to the input shapes. In example1, the output shape is a rectangle of 5's at rows 3-4, cols 3-6. In input, there were 5's at rows 3-4, cols 1-2 and 7-9. So output seems to be a rectangle that is exactly the middle of those two blocks horizontally: left block at 1-2, right block at 7-9. The middle between 2 and 7 is 4.5. So maybe we center at col4 or 5. But output covers 3-6. That is 4 cells centered at 4.5: 3-6. So yes, that is the middle block between left and right blocks. The height is 2 rows (rows 3-4). So output block is exactly the intersection of the rows where both left and right blocks existed. That is rows 3-4. And horizontally, we choose a block of width equal to the sum of widths of the left and right blocks minus something? Actually left width=2, right width=3. Sum=5. But output width=4. So maybe we take the width of the smaller block (2) plus 2? Not clear.\n\nBut maybe the rule is: For each row that has two separate groups of 5's, replace the 5's with a new group of 5's that is centered between the two groups, with a width equal to the distance between the outermost cells of the two groups minus the width of the outermost group? Let's compute distance between outermost cells: left group's rightmost col=2, right group's leftmost col=7. Distance between them = 7-2-1 = 4. Output width=4. Yes! That matches. For example1, left group's rightmost col=2, right group's leftmost col=7. Gap between them = 4 cells (columns 3,4,5,6). Output width=4, exactly that gap. For example2, rows 2-5: left group's rightmost col=6, right group's leftmost col=8. Gap = 8-6-1 = 1 cell (col7). Output width=1, matches. Rows 7-8: left group's rightmost col=3, right group's leftmost col=8. Gap = 8-3-1 = 4 cells (cols 4,5,6,7). Output width=4, matches. So rule: For each row that contains at least two separate groups of 5's, replace the 5's with a new group of 5's that occupies exactly the cells that are between the two groups (i.e., the columns strictly between the rightmost cell of the left group and the leftmost cell of the right group). The new group will have the same number of rows as the original groups (i.e., keep the same row positions). All other cells become zero. This seems to match both examples.\n\nLet's test this rule on example1: Row3 has left group at cols1-2, right group at cols7-9. Gap columns 3-6. So output row3 has 5's at 3-6. Row4 same. Row2 has only left group, no right group, so nothing. Row5 has only right group? Actually row5 has 5's at cols3-5 only (center). No left or right groups. So nothing. Row6-7 have only right group? Row6-7 have 5's at cols3-5 only. So nothing. So output only rows 3-4 with gap group. That matches.\n\nExample2: Row2-5: left group at cols2-6, right group at cols8-9. Gap columns 7 only. So output rows 2-5 have 5 at col7. Row7-8: left group at cols0-3, right group at cols8-9. Gap columns 4-7. Output rows 7-8 have 5 at 4-7. Row6 has only right group at 8-9, no left group, so nothing. Row0 has none. So output matches.\n\nThus the rule is: For each row, if there are two separate contiguous blocks of 5's (i.e., at least two groups separated by at least one zero), replace all 5's in that row with a new block of 5's occupying the cells strictly between the rightmost cell of the leftmost group and the leftmost cell of the rightmost group. All other cells become zero. This effectively draws a new block in the middle gap between the two groups.\n\nNow apply to test input.\n\nTest input grid: 10x10. Let's list rows with 5's:\n\nRow0: 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 7 0 (no 5's)\nRow1: all 0\nRow2: 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same\nRow6: all 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow8: same\nRow9: all 0\n\nSo we have 5's in rows 2-5 and 7-8.\n\nCheck each of those rows for two separate groups:\n\nRows 2-5: Row2 has 5's at cols0-3, and also at cols7-9. Are there any zeros between? Yes, columns 4-6 are zeros. So left group: cols0-3 (width 4). Right group: cols7-9 (width 3). Gap between them: columns 4-6 (3 columns). So we will output 5's at columns 4-6 for rows 2-5.\n\nRows 7-8: Row7 has 5's at cols3-6 (since row7: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0). That's a single group of 4 cells. There is no second group. So no output for these rows. Wait, but row7 also has no second group. So according to rule, nothing. But in example2, row7 had two groups: left group at cols0-3 and right group at 8-9. In test input, row7 only has one group. So no output. But test output given says that rows 7-8 are all zeros. Indeed, the expected output shows zeros for rows 7-8. So that matches rule.\n\nThus the output should have 5's at rows 2-5, columns 4-6. Let's check expected output: Provided expected output has 5's at rows 2-5, columns 4-6. Yes: row2: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0. That matches.\n\nThus the rule is confirmed.\n\nNow we need to produce detailed step-by-step reasoning in the final channel.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Step‑by‑step explanation of the transformation**\n\n1. **Identify the rows that contain colored cells**  \n   In the test grid, only rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 contain any non‑zero values.

All other rows are completely blank and will remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Locate the colored cells in each of those rows**  \n   - Rows 2–5 each contain two separate blocks of the color 5.  \n     *Left block*: columns 0–3 (four consecutive 5’s).  \n     *Right block*: columns 7–9 (three consecutive 5’s).  \n   - Rows 7 and 8 each contain a single block of 5’s at columns 3–6.  \n     There is no second block in these rows.\n\n3. **Determine whether a row has *two* distinct groups**  \n   The rule applies only to rows that contain **at least two** separate groups of 5’s.  \n   - Rows 2–5 satisfy this condition because they have a left group and a right group separated by at least one zero column.  \n   - Rows 7 and 8 do **not** satisfy the condition because they contain only one group.\n\n4. **Compute the “gap” between the two groups**  \n   For a qualifying row, find the rightmost column of the left group and the leftmost column of the right group.  \n   The columns that lie strictly between these two positions form the gap that will be filled in the output.\n\n   *Example for rows 2–5*  \n   - Left group ends at column 3.  \n   - Right group starts at column 7.  \n   - Columns strictly between 3 and 7 are 4, 5, 6.  \n   Thus the gap is three cells wide.\n\n5. **Replace the original colored cells with the new gap**  \n   In each qualifying row, set every cell in the gap columns to the color 5, and set all other cells in that row to zero.  \n   The rest of the grid (rows that did not have two groups) is left untouched.\n\n6. **Apply the rule to each qualifying row**  \n   - **Rows 2, 3, 4, 5**:  \n     The gap columns are 4, 5, 6.  \n     Therefore, place a block of 5’s in columns 4–6 for each of these rows.  \n   - **Rows 7 and 8**:  \n     No second group exists, so no new block is created; all cells remain zero.\n\n7. **Resulting grid**  \n   The only changes are the insertion of a 3‑cell wide block of 5’s in rows 2–5, columns 4–6.  \n   All other rows and columns stay as they were in the input.\n\nThis procedure exactly reproduces the expected output grid: a clean, centered block of 5’s spanning rows 2–5 and columns 4–6, with every other cell zero.",
